/**
 * Identifier Changed signals that the identifier specified in the subject has changed. The subject type MUST be either email or phone, and it MUST specify the old value.
 *
 * This event SHOULD be issued only by the provider that is authoritative over the identifier. For example, if the person that owns john.doe@example.com goes through a name change and wants the new john.row@example.com email then only the email provider example.com SHOULD issue an Identifier Changed event as shown in the example below.
 *
 * If an identifier used as a username or recovery option is changed, at a provider that is not authoritative over that identifier, then Recovery Information Changed SHOULD be used instead.
